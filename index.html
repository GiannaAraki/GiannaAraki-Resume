        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology Major ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I was born and raised on the island of Oâ€™ahu, and recently moved to Riverside, California to pursue an education and continue my softball career. I have been playing softball since I was around three to five years old, so I have had a lot of time developing my skill and dedicating my future to this sport. I spent my entire childhood playing softball and going to school with the same goal I was set to reach at a young age, which was to get an athletic scholarship to a university in the mainland, 

I am currently a second year at the University of California, Riverside as a Psychology major. My main interest is children and child development. I personally understand how much childhood affects how the child develops as they age. I want to be able to learn more about the growing brain of children to fully understand how they interpret events and how it can change their behavior in the future. 
<br><br>

        Since I still have a few more years of college left to go, I figured I could kick start my career by becoming a junior coach for softball teams that are looking for a collegiate athlete to inspire and encourage their players. Having a junior coach around can give these young athletes an opportunity to ask questions and really get to understand the life of a collegiate athlete through a role model. I would also be able to help these young women on their recruiting journey since I have personal experience. I would have the experience and knowledge to teach how to contact certain coaches, and what they are looking for in their future recruits. 

I consider myself to have a great amount of knowledge in the game of softball. I understand all of the NCAA rules which cover coaches conferences, to how many times a player can call time out within a single inning. I personally would have enjoyed having a younger coach around who can do certain workouts and properly demonstrate form for hitting and fielding drills. Having a coach who sits on the side and yells at them to do things is not motivating for our players, so we must be interactive and show them what they are all capable of accomplishing. 
<br><br>

        In the long run, I would like to become a child psychiatrist or even a child therapist. If I am unable to prescribe medication to mentally ill children, I want to become a figure where children feel they are safe to express their emotions. Growing up in Hawaii kept me restricted to the same routine every day , as well as seeing the same people all around the entire island. These events could damage a child's development with social activities and cause social anxiety. Being able to mentally support our children gives them more of a chance to strive to be successful in the future. This is important because eventually, the world will be ran by our children, and it is our responsibility for how they were raised.
